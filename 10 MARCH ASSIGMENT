Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.
ans.  What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.

Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that involves estimating population parameters, such as the mean or proportion, from sample statistics. There are two types of estimation: point estimation and interval estimation.

Point estimation involves using a single value, such as the sample mean, to estimate the population parameter. It is a simple and easy-to-understand method of estimation, but it may not give an accurate estimate of the population parameter.

Interval estimation, on the other hand, involves using a range of values, such as a confidence interval, to estimate the population parameter. It provides a more accurate estimate of the population parameter and gives an idea of the precision of the estimate.


Q2. Write a Python function to estimate the population mean using a sample mean and standard
deviation.
ANS. import math

def estimate_pop_mean(sample_mean, sample_std_dev, sample_size):
    std_error = sample_std_dev / math.sqrt(sample_size)
    z_score = 1.96 # Assuming 95% confidence level
    lower_limit = sample_mean - z_score * std_error
    upper_limit = sample_mean + z_score * std_error
    return (lower_limit, upper_limit)



Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.
ANS.  What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that involves testing a hypothesis about a population parameter using sample data. It is used to determine whether a hypothesis about a population parameter is supported by the sample data.

Hypothesis testing is essential in scientific research and decision-making because it provides a structured way to evaluate the validity of claims and make decisions based on the evidence. It helps to ensure that decisions are not based on chance or bias but on objective evidence.




Q4. Create a hypothesis that states whether the average weight of male college students is greater than
the average weight of female college students.
ANS.  Create a hypothesis that states whether the average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students.

The null hypothesis is that the average weight of male college students is equal to the average weight of female college students, while the alternative hypothesis is that the average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students.

Null hypothesis: μmale = μfemale
Alternative hypothesis: μmale > μfemale



Q5. Write a Python script to conduct a hypothesis test on the difference between two population means,
given a sample from each population.

ANS. import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Generate two random samples
sample1 = np.random.normal(10, 2, 100)
sample2 = np.random.normal(12, 2, 100)

# Perform two-sample t-test
t_statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(sample1, sample2)

# Print the results
print("t-statistic:", t_statistic)
print("p-value:", p_value)





Q6: What is a null and alternative hypothesis? Give some examples.
ANS. A null hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is no significant difference or relationship between two or more variables in a population. An alternative hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is a significant difference or relationship between two or more variables in a population.

Examples of null and alternative hypotheses are:

Null hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the mean weight of apples between two orchards.
Alternative hypothesis: The mean weight of apples from one orchard is greater than the mean weight of apples from the other orchard.

Null hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the proportion of male and female students who prefer coffee.
Alternative hypothesis: The proportion of male students who prefer coffee is different from the proportion of female students who prefer coffee.



Q7: Write down the steps involved in hypothesis testing.
ANS. The steps involved in hypothesis testing are:

State the null and alternative hypotheses.
Determine the appropriate statistical test and the level of significance.
Collect and analyze the sample data.
Calculate the test statistic and the p-value.
Make a decision based on the p-value and the level of significance.
Draw conclusions and interpret the results in the context of the problem.




Q8. Define p-value and explain its significance in hypothesis testing.
ANS. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed one if the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.

A small p-value indicates that the observed results are unlikely to occur by chance alone, and we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. On the other hand, a large p-value indicates that the observed results are likely to occur by chance alone, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis.




Q9. Generate a Student's t-distribution plot using Python's matplotlib library, with the degrees of freedom
parameter set to 10.

ANS. import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import t

# Set the degrees of freedom
df = 10

# Generate the t-distribution values
x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 100)
y = t.pdf(x, df)

# Plot the t-distribution
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Student's t-distribution (df=10)")
plt.xlabel("t-value")
plt.ylabel("Probability density")
plt.show()





Q10. Write a Python program to calculate the two-sample t-test for independent samples, given two
random samples of equal size and a null hypothesis that the population means are equal.
ANS. 
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Generate two random samples
sample1 = np.random.normal(10, 2, 100)
sample2 = np.random.normal(12, 2, 100)

# Perform two-sample t-test
t_statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(sample1, sample2)

# Print the results
print("t-statistic:", t_statistic)
print("p-value:", p_value)




Q11: What is Student’s t distribution? When to use the t-Distribution.
ans.  The Student's t-distribution is a probability distribution that arises in statistical inference when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small. It is used to estimate the mean of a normally distributed population when the sample size is small, typically less than 30. The t-distribution is similar to the standard normal distribution, but it has thicker tails, which makes it more appropriate for smaller sample sizes.

The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a sample mean is significantly different from a population mean, or to construct confidence intervals for the population mean




Q12: What is t-statistic? State the formula for t-statistic.

ANS. The t-statistic is a measure of the difference between a sample mean and a population mean, expressed in terms of the standard error of the sample mean. The formula for the t-statistic is:

t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)

Where:
x̄ is the sample mean
μ is the population mean (or hypothesized value of the population mean)
s is the sample standard deviation
n is the sample size


Q13. A coffee shop owner wants to estimate the average daily revenue for their shop. They take a random
sample of 50 days and find the sample mean revenue to be $500 with a standard deviation of $50.
Estimate the population mean revenue with a 95% confidence interval.

ANS. To estimate the population mean revenue with a 95% confidence interval, we can use the following formula:

Confidence interval = x̄ ± (tα/2 * s/√n)

Where:
x̄ is the sample mean revenue ($500)
s is the sample standard deviation ($50)
n is the sample size (50)
tα/2 is the t-value for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom (from a t-table or calculator), which is approximately 2.009

Plugging in the values, we get:

Confidence interval = 500 ± (2.009 * 50/√50)
Confidence interval = 500 ± 14.14

Therefore, we can say with 95% confidence that the population mean revenue is between $485.86 and $514.14.



Q14. A researcher hypothesizes that a new drug will decrease blood pressure by 10 mmHg. They conduct a
clinical trial with 100 patients and find that the sample mean decrease in blood pressure is 8 mmHg with a
standard deviation of 3 mmHg. Test the hypothesis with a significance level of 0.05.

ANS.  To test the hypothesis that the new drug decreases blood pressure by 10 mmHg with a significance level of 0.05, we can use a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis is that the mean decrease in blood pressure is equal to 10 mmHg, while the alternative hypothesis is that the mean decrease in blood pressure is less than 10 mmHg.

The formula for the t-statistic in a one-sample t-test is:

t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)

Where:
x̄ is the sample mean decrease in blood pressure (8 mmHg)
μ is the hypothesized value of the population mean decrease in blood pressure (10 mmHg)
s is the sample standard deviation (3 mmHg)
n is the sample size (100)

Plugging in the values, we get:

t = (8 - 10) / (3 / √100)
t = -2 / 0.3
t = -6.67

The t-value for a one-tailed test with 99 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.05 is approximately -1.66 (from a t-table or calculator). Since our calculated t-value (-6.67) is less than the critical value (-1.66), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence to suggest that the new drug decreases blood pressure by less than 10 mmHg.



Q15. An electronics company produces a certain type of product with a mean weight of 5 pounds and a
standard deviation of 0.5 pounds. A random sample of 25 products is taken, and the sample mean weight
is found to be 4.8 pounds. Test the hypothesis that the true mean weight of the products is less than 5
pounds with a significance level of 0.01.

ANS. To test the hypothesis that the true mean weight of the products is less than 5 pounds with a significance level of 0.01, we can use a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis is that the mean weight is equal to 5 pounds, while the alternative hypothesis is that the mean weight is less than 5 pounds.

The formula for the t-statistic in a one-sample t-test is:

t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)

Where:
x̄ is the sample mean weight (4.8 pounds)
μ is the hypothesized value of the population mean weight (5 pounds)
s is the sample standard deviation (0.5 pounds)
n is the sample size (25)

Plugging in the values, we get:

t = (4.8 - 5) / (0.5 / √25)
t = -2

The t-value for a one-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.01 is approximately -2.492 (from a t-table or calculator). Since our calculated t-value (-2) is greater than the critical value (-2.492), we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the true mean weight of the products is less than 5 pounds.


Q16. Two groups of students are given different study materials to prepare for a test. The first group (n1 =
30) has a mean score of 80 with a standard deviation of 10, and the second group (n2 = 40) has a mean
score of 75 with a standard deviation of 8. Test the hypothesis that the population means for the two
groups are equal with a significance level of 0.01.

ANS. To test the hypothesis that the population means for the two groups are equal with a significance level of 0.01, we can use a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis is that the mean scores are equal for both groups, while the alternative hypothesis is that the means are not equal.

The formula for the t-statistic in a two-sample t-test is:

t = (x̄1 - x̄2) / (sqrt((s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2)))

Where:
x̄1 is the sample mean for the first group (80)
x̄2 is the sample mean for the second group (75)
s1 is the sample standard deviation for the first group (10)
s2 is the sample standard deviation for the second group (8)
n1 is the sample size for the first group (30)
n2 is the sample size for the second group (40)

Plugging in the values, we get:

t = (80 - 75) / (sqrt((10^2/30) + (8^2/40)))
t = 3.19

The t-value for a two-tailed test with 68 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.01 is approximately ±2.618 (from a t-table or calculator). Since our calculated t-value (3.19) is greater than the positive critical value (2.618), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the population means for the two groups are not equal.


Q17. A marketing company wants to estimate the average number of ads watched by viewers during a TV
program. They take a random sample of 50 viewers and find that the sample mean is 4 with a standard
deviation of 1.5. Estimate the population mean with a 99% confidence interval.

ANS. To estimate the population mean number of ads watched by viewers with a 99% confidence interval, we can use the following formula:

Confidence interval = x̄ ± (tα/2 * s/√n)

Where:
x̄ is the sample mean number of ads watched (4)
s is the sample standard deviation (1.5)
n is the sample size (50)
tα/2 is the t-value for a 99% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom (from a t-table or calculator), which is approximately 2.681

Plugging in the values, we get:

Confidence interval = 4 ± (2.681 * 1.5/√50)
Confidence interval = 4 ± 0.54

Therefore, we can
